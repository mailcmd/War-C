# War-C

War-C (**W**eb **AR**row **C**ontrol) is a simple javascript class to allow control navigation on a webpage with arrow keys on your keyboard. The concept is simple, you can move throught some selected elements on your webpage just pressing arrow keys and trigger click event pressing ENTER key.

## How it works?

First you need instantiate the class and second... well, basically that's all, it is ready. But obviously if you like can pass some parameters for better tunning of War-C. 

When you create an instance of the class, every element that match with the selector (you can pass one or the default selector will be "*button:visible, input[type="button"]:visible, a:visible*")
